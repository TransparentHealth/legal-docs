Share My Health places a high priority on maintaining the confidentiality of its records,
agreements, documents and other sensitive information.


I understand that I may be given access to confidential information about health care consumers.
I acknowledge that my access to confidential information is for the sole purpose of performing my responsibilities and for no other purpose. I will access only that information that I need to perform my job and will not seek access to any information that I do not need to perform my job.


I understand that protected health information (PHI) or any other confidential information
(CI) may not be shared with anyone who does not have an official need to know. 

HIV/AIDS. The information in this portal may contain information about HIV/AIDS, which is protected under the Article 27-F of the NY Public Health Law. Re-disclosure of this information is subject to NY State and other laws and regulations, with which you must comply.
