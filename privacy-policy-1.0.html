Share My Health will use the information you provide to confirm your eligibility to establish a Service Account, to protect against unauthorized access to the Service Account you create, and to communicate with you regarding the Service. For example, when Share My Health sends you an email, it will include the security phrase that you provided; if you receive an email purporting to be from Share My Health that does not contain the security phrase you set on your Service Account, you should not trust that the email was sent by Share My Health.</p><p style="margin: 1em 0px; word-wrap: break-word;"><em>Linking Service Accounts</em></p><p style="margin: 1em 0px; word-wrap: break-word;">For Share My Health Service Accounts, you also will need to provide the username and password you use for each Share My Health Account that you wish to have linked to your Share My Health Services Account.

Those Share My Health Servers are kept in secure locations and physical access to them is highly-controlled and tracked.</p><p style="margin: 1em 0px; word-wrap: break-word;">Share My Health use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) certificate technology so that you have assurance when using the Service that it is genuine and operated by Share My Health. That technology also allows us to establish a secure, encrypted connection between the Service and the web browser you are using when you connect to the Service. When the secure, encrypted connection exists, the address appearing in your browser’s address bar will begin with https:// (not just http://). If you use a high-security browser, your browser address bar will turn green to indicate your secure connection.</p><p style="margin: 1em 0px; word-wrap: break-word;">Please note, however, that if the Service re-directs you to web sites operated by other organizations (such as a healthcare organization or healthcare applications at which you have an active account) or you click on a third-party link, you no longer are connected to the Service. At that point, the nature of your connection is governed and controlled by the technology adopted and put into place by the organization operating the web site to which you’ve been re-directed.</p><p style="margin: 1em 0px; word-wrap: break-word;">Other technical safeguards that are employed at Share My Health to protect your Personal Information include the following: Service Account passwords are stored in an encrypted format. Share My Health provides you guidance on how to create secure passwords. Share My Health can be accessed only when you are using high-security browsers of certain versions, all of which must be SSL-compatible. All transfers of data between systems made via the Internet in connection with your use of the Service occur in encrypted form using SSL protocol or similar technology this is widely regarded to be secure and reliable. Firewalls and audit trails are used to safeguard your information further.</p><h2 id="how-you-control-the-sharing-of-your-personal-information" style="clear: both;font-size: 1.8em; font-weight: bold; margin: 1.275em 0px 0.85em;border-bottom-width: 1px; border-bottom-style: solid; border-bottom-color: rgb(230, 230, 230);"><a name="how-you-control-the-sharing-of-your-personal-information" href="#how-you-control-the-sharing-of-your-personal-information" style="text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;color: rgb(50, 105, 160);"></a>How you control the sharing of your Personal Information </h2><p style="margin-top: 0px;margin: 1em 0px; word-wrap: break-word;">Share My Health allows you to transfer your Personal Information to and from your Service Account to Service Providers. You control those transfers through the features provided within the Service. For instance, you can authorize healthcare providers at the organizations where you have Share My Health Accounts to pull designated portions of your Personal Information from your Service Account for inclusion in your electronic medical record at those organizations. Only those provider organizations that you authorize will be able to initiate such transfers, and they will be able to transfer only the Personal Information from your Service Accounts that you choose to make available to them. To enable this functionality, the Service makes the fact that you are a Share My Health Service Account holder known to those organizations where you have linked Share My Health Accounts.</p><p style="margin: 1em 0px; word-wrap: break-word;">You also will be able to download your Personal Information to your local computer or portable storage devices, or to direct that such Personal<br style="clear: both;">Information be transmitted to other entities. Again, all such transfers of your Personal Information will be solely in your control, as directed by you through your use of the Service.</p><p style="margin: 1em 0px; word-wrap: break-word;">Please note that Share My Health cannot control and is not responsible for the privacy and security of your Personal Information once it has left Share My Health in accordance with your requests and directives when using the Service. Share My Health cannot retrieve that information after you’ve shared it, and cannot control or restrict the use of Personal Information by other organizations. For instance, designating within your Share My Health Services Account that portions of your Personal Information are not to be shared restricts only the transfer of the Personal Information via the Service; it does not extend those restrictions to organizations to which you’ve sent that information or from which your Share My Health Services Account has received it, such as a healthcare organization where you have a Share My Health Account.

Share My Health will provide such third parties access to your Personal Information only (i) when such access is necessary to accomplish the activity for which Share My Health has engaged the third party; and (ii) when the third-party is contractually bound to us: (a) to use the information only in connection with accomplishment of the activity for which they’ve been engaged and (b) to provide administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect the confidentiality and security of the information.</p><h2 id="what-happens-to-your-personal-information-when-you-close-a-service-account" style="clear: both;font-size: 1.8em; font-weight: bold; margin: 1.275em 0px 0.85em;border-bottom-width: 1px; border-bottom-style: solid; border-bottom-color: rgb(230, 230, 230);"><a name="what-happens-to-your-personal-information-when-you-close-a-service-account" href="#what-happens-to-your-personal-information-when-you-close-a-service-account" style="text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;color: rgb(50, 105, 160);"></a>What happens to your Personal Information when you close a Service Account</h2><p style="margin-top: 0px;margin: 1em 0px; word-wrap: break-word;">You can choose to close a Service Account at any time. If you choose to do so, Share My Health will retain your Personal Information until you request permanent deletion. Please note that closing a Service Account affects only your Personal Information that is stored on Share My Health Servers. It does not affect, alter or accomplish the deletion of any Personal Information that is stored or maintained on other systems, such as those of your healthcare providers or the organizations at which you have Share My Health Accounts.</p><p style="margin: 1em 0px; word-wrap: break-word;">After deletion, your Personal Information may persist in Backup Files for up to a year and in the Audit Files for longer periods of time based upon government agency and private organization guidelines and recommendations that pertain to analogous categories of data and information. Backup and Audit Files are never stored on computers connected to the Internet and the data in such files is not readily or even easily accessible. Share My Health therefore reserves the right to decline to process requests to provide access to, to delete or to correct inaccurate Personal Information if such requests would be impractical, require disproportionate technical efforts, jeopardize the security of other individuals’ personal information or interfere with Share My Health’s legal obligations or its legitimate efforts to protect its business interests.</p><h2 id="visitors-only-of-legal-age-of-majority" style="clear: both;font-size: 1.8em; font-weight: bold; margin: 1.275em 0px 0.85em;border-bottom-width: 1px; border-bottom-style: solid; border-bottom-color: rgb(230, 230, 230);"><a name="visitors-only-of-legal-age-of-majority" href="#visitors-only-of-legal-age-of-majority" style="text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;color: rgb(50, 105, 160);"></a>Visitors only of legal age of majority</h2><p style="margin-top: 0px;margin: 1em 0px; word-wrap: break-word;">Share My Health is designed and intended for those who are at least 18 years old.

For example, when Share My Health sends you an email, it will include the security phrase that you provided; if you receive an email purporting to be from Share My Health that does not contain the security phrase you set on your Service Account, you should not trust that the email was sent by Share My Health.</p><p style="margin: 1em 0px; word-wrap: break-word;"><em>Linking Service Accounts</em></p><p style="margin: 1em 0px; word-wrap: break-word;">For Share My Health Service Accounts, you also will need to provide the username and password you use for each Share My Health Account that you wish to have linked to your Share My Health Services Account. Please note Share My Health does not store or retain any of your Share My Health Account usernames or passwords on Share My Health Servers. Instead, it uses that information to create secure credentialing mechanisms to ensure accurate future system identification between Share My Health Service and your Share My Health Account provider organizations’ web sites in connection with your use of the Service.</p><p style="margin: 1em 0px; word-wrap: break-word;"><em>Use of Tracking Technologies and Cookies</em></p><p style="margin: 1em 0px; word-wrap: break-word;">Share My Health may also collect and record certain information from your browser each time you connect to the Service such as your IP address, browser type and language, date, time and duration of your connection, and the actions that you perform.

Those Share My Health Servers are kept in secure locations and physical access to them is highly-controlled and tracked.</p><p style="margin: 1em 0px; word-wrap: break-word;">Share My Health use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) certificate technology so that you have assurance when using the Service that it is genuine and operated by Share My Health. That technology also allows us to establish a secure, encrypted connection between the Service and the web browser you are using when you connect to the Service. When the secure, encrypted connection exists, the address appearing in your browser’s address bar will begin with https:// (not just http://). If you use a high-security browser, your browser address bar will turn green to indicate your secure connection.</p><p style="margin: 1em 0px; word-wrap: break-word;">Please note, however, that if the Service re-directs you to web sites operated by other organizations (such as a healthcare organization or healthcare applications at which you have an active account) or you click on a third-party link, you no longer are connected to the Service. At that point, the nature of your connection is governed and controlled by the technology adopted and put into place by the organization operating the web site to which you’ve been re-directed.</p><p style="margin: 1em 0px; word-wrap: break-word;">Other technical safeguards that are employed at Share My Health to protect your Personal Information include the following: Service Account passwords are stored in an encrypted format. Share My Health provides you guidance on how to create secure passwords. Share My Health can be accessed only when you are using high-security browsers of certain versions, all of which must be SSL-compatible. All transfers of data between systems made via the Internet in connection with your use of the Service occur in encrypted form using SSL protocol or similar technology this is widely regarded to be secure and reliable. Firewalls and audit trails are used to safeguard your information further.</p><h2 id="how-you-control-the-sharing-of-your-personal-information" style="clear: both;font-size: 1.8em; font-weight: bold; margin: 1.275em 0px 0.85em;border-bottom-width: 1px; border-bottom-style: solid; border-bottom-color: rgb(230, 230, 230);"><a name="how-you-control-the-sharing-of-your-personal-information" href="#how-you-control-the-sharing-of-your-personal-information" style="text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;color: rgb(50, 105, 160);"></a>How you control the sharing of your Personal Information </h2><p style="margin-top: 0px;margin: 1em 0px; word-wrap: break-word;">Share My Health allows you to transfer your Personal Information to and from your Service Account to Service Providers. You control those transfers through the features provided within the Service. For instance, you can authorize healthcare providers at the organizations where you have Share My Health Accounts to pull designated portions of your Personal Information from your Service Account for inclusion in your electronic medical record at those organizations. Only those provider organizations that you authorize will be able to initiate such transfers, and they will be able to transfer only the Personal Information from your Service Accounts that you choose to make available to them. To enable this functionality, the Service makes the fact that you are a Share My Health Service Account holder known to those organizations where you have linked Share My Health Accounts.</p><p style="margin: 1em 0px; word-wrap: break-word;">You also will be able to download your Personal Information to your local computer or portable storage devices, or to direct that such Personal<br style="clear: both;">Information be transmitted to other entities. Again, all such transfers of your Personal Information will be solely in your control, as directed by you through your use of the Service.</p><p style="margin: 1em 0px; word-wrap: break-word;">Please note that Share My Health cannot control and is not responsible for the privacy and security of your Personal Information once it has left Share My Health in accordance with your requests and directives when using the Service. Share My Health cannot retrieve that information after you’ve shared it, and cannot control or restrict the use of Personal Information by other organizations. For instance, designating within your Share My Health Services Account that portions of your Personal Information are not to be shared restricts only the transfer of the Personal Information via the Service; it does not extend those restrictions to organizations to which you’ve sent that information or from which your Share My Health Services Account has received it, such as a healthcare organization where you have a Share My Health Account.

Share My Health may disclose your Personal Information if, in good faith, it considers necessary to:</p><ul>
<li style="display: list-item; line-height: 1.4em;">comply with any applicable law compelling a disclosure of the information, to comply with legal process served on us, or in response to the request of a law enforcement or government regulatory agency in circumstances that Share My Health believes warrant the disclosure;</li><li style="display: list-item; line-height: 1.4em;">protect the personal safety or health of the public or users of the Service;</li><li style="display: list-item; line-height: 1.4em;">protect and defend Share My Health’s rights and property, including the enforcement of the Terms or Service that govern your use of the Service;</li><li style="display: list-item; line-height: 1.4em;">protect against or address fraud or security breaches; or </li><li style="display: list-item; line-height: 1.4em;">fulfill its obligations as part of any actual or proposed purchase, merger or acquisition of any part of our business, provided that use of such Personal Information shall be limited to those purposes disclosed in this Privacy Policy.</li></ul><p style="margin: 1em 0px; word-wrap: break-word;">In addition, Share My Health may at times engage other companies or individuals to perform certain activities on its behalf and related to its provision of the Service, such as assistance in improving software, off-site storage of information for disaster recovery, web site hosting, or technical assistance regarding operating systems, web browsers or other non-Share My Health software with which the Service might interact. Share My Health will provide such third parties access to your Personal Information only (i) when such access is necessary to accomplish the activity for which Share My Health has engaged the third party; and (ii) when the third-party is contractually bound to us: (a) to use the information only in connection with accomplishment of the activity for which they’ve been engaged and (b) to provide administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect the confidentiality and security of the information.</p><h2 id="what-happens-to-your-personal-information-when-you-close-a-service-account" style="clear: both;font-size: 1.8em; font-weight: bold; margin: 1.275em 0px 0.85em;border-bottom-width: 1px; border-bottom-style: solid; border-bottom-color: rgb(230, 230, 230);"><a name="what-happens-to-your-personal-information-when-you-close-a-service-account" href="#what-happens-to-your-personal-information-when-you-close-a-service-account" style="text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;color: rgb(50, 105, 160);"></a>What happens to your Personal Information when you close a Service Account</h2><p style="margin-top: 0px;margin: 1em 0px; word-wrap: break-word;">You can choose to close a Service Account at any time. If you choose to do so, Share My Health will retain your Personal Information until you request permanent deletion. Please note that closing a Service Account affects only your Personal Information that is stored on Share My Health Servers. It does not affect, alter or accomplish the deletion of any Personal Information that is stored or maintained on other systems, such as those of your healthcare providers or the organizations at which you have Share My Health Accounts.</p><p style="margin: 1em 0px; word-wrap: break-word;">After deletion, your Personal Information may persist in Backup Files for up to a year and in the Audit Files for longer periods of time based upon government agency and private organization guidelines and recommendations that pertain to analogous categories of data and information. Backup and Audit Files are never stored on computers connected to the Internet and the data in such files is not readily or even easily accessible. Share My Health therefore reserves the right to decline to process requests to provide access to, to delete or to correct inaccurate Personal Information if such requests would be impractical, require disproportionate technical efforts, jeopardize the security of other individuals’ personal information or interfere with Share My Health’s legal obligations or its legitimate efforts to protect its business interests.</p><h2 id="visitors-only-of-legal-age-of-majority" style="clear: both;font-size: 1.8em; font-weight: bold; margin: 1.275em 0px 0.85em;border-bottom-width: 1px; border-bottom-style: solid; border-bottom-color: rgb(230, 230, 230);"><a name="visitors-only-of-legal-age-of-majority" href="#visitors-only-of-legal-age-of-majority" style="text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;color: rgb(50, 105, 160);"></a>Visitors only of legal age of majority</h2><p style="margin-top: 0px;margin: 1em 0px; word-wrap: break-word;">Share My Health is designed and intended for those who are at least 18 years old.
